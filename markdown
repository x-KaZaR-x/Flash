#----------------> RULES <--------------------#
```

```css
Our general mindset is to have good time on the game so we are asking for common sense.
These rules might be changed if itâ€™s needed or if you are asking for. To do so, go in #ideas-and-sugestions. 
This is a pre alpha game although a lot of the problems have been fixed theres still bugs and things might despawn.

```md
# 1. Enjoy.

# 2. No building on roads or bridges

# 3. One car and one tent per Base

# 4. No stealing off other players

# 5. Police cars and swat trucks is for admin use only

# 6. If you're ingame try to keep discord active so players and admin can contact you if needed. And that can save your life ;)

- You have to react with a thumbsup to these rules so we know you did read them in order to be added on the whitelist :p
